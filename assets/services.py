"""Write-side business logic for check-outs and returns.

Kept out of the views so the rules can be unit-tested (and called from the
admin, a management command or a task) without going through HTTP.

Locking strategy (business rule 7)
----------------------------------
check_out() takes a row lock on the Asset (SELECT ... FOR UPDATE) inside a
transaction *before* reading its status. Two concurrent requests for the same
asset therefore serialise on that lock: the second one blocks until the first
commits, then re-reads the row, sees CHECKED_OUT and gets 409.

The Employee row is locked too, so two concurrent check-outs of *different*
assets by the *same* employee cannot both pass the "at most three open"
count (rule 3) - without that lock both would count 2 and both would insert.

Locks are always taken in the order Asset -> Employee, and return_checkout()
never locks an Employee, so the two code paths cannot deadlock each other.

The partial unique index uniq_open_checkout_per_asset is a second, independent
line of defence: if the lock were ever bypassed, the INSERT itself fails with
IntegrityError, which is also mapped to 409.
